        <item>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest
           living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like
           shape and its leopardlike colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely
           long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.</item>
        <item>Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of shortbodied, tailless amphibians
           composing the order Anura (Ancient Greek an-, without + oura, tail). The oldest fossil
           "proto-frog" appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests
           their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago.</item>
        <item>Monkeys are haplorhine ("dry-nosed") primates, a paraphyletic group generally possessing tails
           and consisting of approximately 260 known living species. Many monkey species are tree-dwelling
           (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most
           species are also active during the day (diurnal).
